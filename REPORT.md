Advanced Task Description
This task was programmed to show ostracization and stigmatization. The
stigmatized attribute is color. The attacker bots are red and the player is
blue. The red bots see the blue bot and attack (shoot). If the player gets close
to an attacker bot then the attacker bot will start to turn blue. After a short
period of time near the attacker bot, the attacker bot will get demoralized,
stop shooting, and hide from the bots. The other attacker bots will see that the
stigmatized attacker bot has been stigmatized and follow and attack said bot in
addition to the player. If the player achieves more time near the stigmatized
attacker bot, the attacker bot will actually leave the attacker bot society
entirely and become entirely blue. If the attacker bot is entirely blue it will
aid the player by remaining near the player. The player is able to do this
process in any order to all attacker bots.
